2_pods_creating_messages_h2_db_image1.png and 2_pods_creating_messages_h2_db_image2.png

we can see:
* we have 2 pods with the same docker image
* we have a h2 database running - CHANGE THIS! MUST BE A POSTGRES....
* we have an entity called "Message" with 2 fields: id and content
* we have the endpoint "/messages" that populate a h2 database with a new entry Message with content "asd" and the ID is autogenerated
* was made GET request to k8 service -> http://10.110.53.111/messages
* the k8 balanced the request between the 2 pods
* was made 9 GET requests, 6 were processed by the pod cyclingchat-deployment-76d79f987b-lw75d and the other 3 were processed by the pod cyclingchat-deployment-76d79f987b-7hchj
* on the h2 database we have 9 Messages with content "asd" as expected :)

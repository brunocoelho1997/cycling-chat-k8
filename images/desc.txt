2_pods_creating_messages_image1.png and 2_pods_creating_messages_image2.png

we can see:
* we have 2 pods with the same docker image
* we have a postgres database running
* we have an entity called "Message" with 2 fields: id and content
* we have the endpoint "/messages" that populate the postgres database with a new entry Message with content "asd", the pod name and the ID is autogenerated
* was made GET request to k8 service -> http://service-ip/messages
* the k8 balanced the request between the 2 pods
* was made GET requests, X were processed by the pod cycling-chat-cycling-chat-helm-688fd55f7f-d9g5d and the other Y were processed by the pod cycling-chat-cycling-chat-helm-688fd55f7f-wgq7t
* on the postgres database we have Z Messages with content "asd" as expected :)
